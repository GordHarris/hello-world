# hello-world
A home for first tests as I learn github.  Not likely of any use to anyone but me for learning purposes.
I intend to use github for my project called FreeDome, which is a 3 channel dome projection system for arts and science.
I wish to explore ideas of Visual Music - - methods of generating interesting visualizations or accompaniments to music.
I am using Touch Designer and MAX MSP Jitter plus various IOS apps at present.  For TD I need to learn some Python.
My first goal is to get a simple but flexible movie playback system for an art show in January 2010 at ECFTA, the first install.
